## 🛬 How to get here

<!-- The best way to travel is [via a plane to Lanzarote airport](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-lanzarote-arrecife-ace). 

It's also possible to fly to other island airports and then take a short flight. Fuertaventura is closest being 30min away with a ferry.

From the Lanzarote airport you can take a taxi to the venue, they have a flat rate and it should be around 20-25 EUR.

[Renting a car](https://autoreisen.com/) is usually quite cheap, around 100-150 eur for the week. -->

### Quickest
For people coming from outside Asia, the quickest way to get to Chiang Mai is by plane, usually with layover in Bangkok.

### Cost Efficient
Domestic flights in Thailand are relatively inexpensive, starting from as low as 25$.

Therefore it might be cheaper to just book a flight to Bangkok and then continue to Chiang Mai via a separate domestic flight, or via the night train which is a nice experience for many travelers.

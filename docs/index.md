## üõ¨ How to get here

### Quickest
For people coming from outside Asia, the quickest way to get to Chiang Mai is by plane, usually with layover in Bangkok.

### Cost Efficient
Domestic flights in Thailand are relatively inexpensive, starting from as low as 25$.

In some cases it migth be cheaper to book a flight to Bangkok and then continue to Chiang Mai via a separate domestic flight, or via the night train which is a nice experience for many travelers.
